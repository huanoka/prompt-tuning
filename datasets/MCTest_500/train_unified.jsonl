And she didn't want to dance alone, because that would make her feel sad.  But she had to hurry, since it was getting late, and she had to sleep soon. She was so excited, that she barely touched her baked potato she had during suppertime. She also had chicken, some green beans, and corn on the cob.  She came down to four choices for what she could wear to the dance. a pink dress, a green dress, a red dress, and a yellow dress. She tried on each one and looked at herself in the mirror to see how she looked. She chose the yellow dress, because it was the prettiest. After making her choice, she changed into her pajamas and got in bed. She turned the light out and fell asleep. She dreamed about the fun she would have at the dance. Sally smiled as she slept.", "question": "multiple: Why did Sally want to look nice?", "answer": "C"}

One day John and Rick started a peach farm so that they would never run out of their favorite fruit. They planted hundreds of peach trees and waited for them to bear fruit. After 6 years of waiting, 1 lonely peach finally grew on one of the trees John and Rick planted. They picked the peach and brought it home. They waited until the weekend to eat it in case more peaches grew, but none did. John and Rick were sad and confused about their farm. They planted hundreds of trees and were sure that there would be thousands of peaches for them to eat in no time. Another peach never grew on their farm for 17 years. One day, a mighty crack of thunder led to a strong storm. Lightning hit the ground over and over, and John and Rick were scared their trees might be killed. The next morning, every tree on the farm had more than 10 peaches on it. John and Rick started shouting for joy.", "question": "one: Who was John's best friend?", "answer": "A"}

He had gone down to the beach for the day, but it had started raining, so he had started driving back. But he had gotten lost. Now, he thought he was on the right way back.  His headlights were not very strong. He could only see a few feet in front of him, except when the lightning hit. When the thunder came after, his squirrel, Joey, and his hamster, Broey, turned over in their sleep.  Suddenly, lightning and thunder hit at the same time. There was a bright light and a crunching sound. A tree fell in front of the car!  Sam hit the brakes. The car slowed down and stopped, and he got out. Sam walked up to the tree. He tried pushing it. It was too heavy. What would he do?  He heard the car door open and shut behind him.  It was Joey! And Broey!  Together, the three of them pushed. Joey and Broey were small, but strong. And together, they moved the tree.  They got back in the car. Sam was wet, and turned on the heater. He was tired, but he knew he would get home now - thanks to his animal friends.", "question": "multiple: Was Sam lost?", "answer": "D"}

There was once a little fairy named Twinkles who lived in an old willow tree. The tree grew next to a river in a large, green forest. Twinkles loved to fly around the forest with her best friend Betsy the Bat. Betsy was a very forgetful bat. One day Twinkles and Betsy were playing next to the bushes by the river bank when Betsy shouted, \"Oh no, I've forgotten my lunch that my mom packed for me today! It is late in the afternoon and I am hungry.\"  \"Do not worry,\" said Twinkles. \"I am going to wait here for you until you get back.\"  With that, Betsy flew off toward her home in the wet cave near the other end of the river. An hour went by and Betsy still had not returned. \"Hmm,\" thought Twinkles, \"I wonder where Betsy went off to.\" Twinkles flew off to find her best friend.  Soon, she heard a voice calling from down below. \"Help me! I'm stuck!\" Twinkles looked down. Sure enough, it was Betsy! She had been caught in a pile of sticky mud near the mouth of the cave.   \"Don't worry, I am coming to save you!\" cried Twinkles. Twinkles swooped down to the ground. She found a strong stick nearby that she could use to help her pull Betsy out of the thick mud. Betsy grabbed the end of the stick that Twinkles held out to her. After some heavy tugging, Betsy was free.  \"Thank you so very much for pulling me out of the mud! I was looking for some berries to use for jam down by the river. They grow on the bushes there. I wanted some for a little dessert after my lunch. I accidentally walked into the pile of mud on the floor and got stuck.\"  \"No problem,\" said Twinkles. \"That's what friends are for.\"", "question": "multiple: How did Twinkles free Betsy from the mud?", "answer": "A"}

I did not have school and my mom did not have work. When I woke up we ate breakfast and got ready for the day. My mom started to clean up the house so I went up to my room to play with my toys. My mom came upstairs and told me, \"If you clean up your room there is a great surprise in it for you.\" I was very excited about what the surprise was but not very excited to clean my room. My mom left and closed the door. I looked around and saw how messy my room was. And I really did not want to clean it. So what I did was pick up all my stuff in my room and put it all in my closet. It did not take me very long so I hung out in my room for a little bit longer before heading downstairs to the basement to tell my mom I was ready for my surprise. She came upstairs to see how I did and immediately saw what I did. She was not happy about it.

There are lots of pigs, squirrels and raccoon living in the park. Sometimes I feed them bread and crackers. Their favorite thing to eat is ham. After I am done at the park I go to the store to buy some ice cream. Sometimes I see my friend Christopher and he eats his ice cream with me. Christopher also likes feeding the animals. His favorite animal at the park is the squirrel.", "question": "multiple: What is not found in the lake?", "answer": "A"}

He climbed under his bed and listened to the wind outside. He had his favorite toy gun to keep him safe, but he was still scared because his parents weren't back yet. His brother Zack had given him the gun. Bill started to think he could hear voices in the wind. It sounded like a strange kind of chanting. He started to shake and hug his toy gun. He said, \"I'm not afraid of you. If you try to hurt me I'll shoot you.\" After that he felt a little better. But then he jumped as his bedroom door slammed shut. He hit his head on the bottom of his bed and it hurt. He looked out from under his blanket and saw a strange orange light in his room. He was worried that it was on fire, but he couldn't smell any smoke.", "question": "multiple: What did Bill think had happened to his room after the door slammed shut?", "answer": "C"}

{"context": "A: Telling ghost stories. B: Taking a shower. C: Fighting with other boys. D: Calling home at least every two days.. This summer Frank and his friends went to Boy Scout camp for two weeks. At camp they had lots of fun activities like swimming, wood carving, and telling ghost stories. At camp there weren't any restaurants or grocery stores, so for food they would have to make their own meals. One thing they could do is make peanut butter sandwiches, which every scout was given at the start of camp. But pretty soon everyone was sick of peanut butter sandwiches and wanted to eat something else instead. Some boys went out into the forest and picked out berries and roots that were safe to eat. Some boys even took out the boat and went fishing. They came back with a big fish that they cleaned and cooked themselves.  At first, Frank's mom was very worried about letting Frank go to camp. She was worried that he could get lost in the woods and be eaten by a bear. She was worried that he might get into a fight with the other boys. She was even worried that he wouldn't shower or take a bath for the whole two weeks.
