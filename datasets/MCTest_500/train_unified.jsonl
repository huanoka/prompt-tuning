One of the most memorable adventures that Scott and Boscoe had happened when Scott was 12. Scott wanted to have a little fun. He also wanted to adventure with Boscoe. Scott had got done eating breakfast and wanted to ride his bicycle. Boscoe was walking and Scott was riding his bicycle down by the park very close to the river near Scott's house. He wanted to do a little adventuring. Boscoe was walking next to the shore and started barking his head off! Scott wasn't sure what he was barking at, so he got off his bicycle and ran down into the river to see what all the noise was about.   All of the sudden, Boscoe fell in the water and was taken down stream with the fast water. Scott yelled, \"Boscoe!\" and he was off. He jumped into the water and began swimming after Boscoe.

There was a straw bed for the lions to sleep on, and all visitors loved to watch the baby lion cub. Well, a monkey (with claws) came into the lion's cage all of a sudden!

{"context": "There was once an old tree. The children from all around the neighborhood loved to climb the tree. The children also liked to sit under the tree, hang on it and play games around it. Animals liked the tree as well. Birds, cats and all kinds of lizards would climb the tree too! Rabbits, dogs, frogs and and many ground animals loved to play around the bottom of the tree.  One day the children learned the tree was going to be cut down. This made the children, and maybe the animals, very sad. Why was it being cut down? Was it too old? Too weak? Maybe it was dying? The children learned it was because the tree was sick.  The children were very sad to hear about this. They wondered where they would play from now on. The tree was their favorite place and they didn't want to see it go. One little boy, named John, went home to tell his parents the story. His parents could tell he was sad so they told him something that made him very happy. What was it? He wondered. Was a jungle gym going to be put in? A mall, maybe a park? In fact, even better than that, a new tree would be planted in its place.  John was so happy he rushed off to tell his friends. \"Big news!\", he shouted. \"My parents told me a new tree is going to be planted here over the old one!\" All his friends cheered in excitement, now knowing they wouldn't lose their favorite spot. John and his friends went to celebrate by getting ice cream. His friends liked chocolate and vanilla but John got strawberry.", "question": "What kind of ice cream did John get?", "answer": "Strawberry."}

He had never had a strawberry before.  \"Oh,\" he thought, \"strawberries must be very tasty.\"  He thought about how red they were, and how sweet they must taste.  \"I have to have a strawberry,\" said Andy.  So Andy went to talk to his friends, to find out if they had any strawberries.  He walked to a big field where he saw his friend Billy the Bison.  Andy asked Billy if he had any strawberries.  \"No, I don't,\" said Billy, \"All I have is a banana.\"  Andy was sad, because he really wanted a strawberry, but he wouldn't stop there.  Andy walked to the river to find his friend Charlie, the duck.  It was a long way to walk, but Andy really wanted a strawberry.  When he finally got there, he asked, \"Do you have any strawberries?\"  \"No,\" said Charlie, \"I only have is an apple.\"  This made Andy really sad, but he wouldn't stop there.  Andy knew that he only knew one other friend who might have a strawberry, and that was David the Elephant.  So he walked and walked and walked until he was finally at his friend David's house.  Andy was tired, but wouldn't give up.  Andy asked, \"Do you have any strawberries?\"  David said, \"Yes!  Help yourself.\"  Andy was excited, and finally tasted his first strawberry.

One evening, after a big meal of chicken and potatoes at Molly's house the girls went outside to play hide and go seek. They almost turned back because they thought they saw a wolf. Luckily, it ended up being a shadow from an old boot. Jessica counted to fifty to give Molly time to hide. In the middle of counting, Jessica heard a sound! Jessica opened up her eyes to see Molly had found a puppy! The puppy had a bell on its collar, so the girls knew it must belong to someone. They carried the puppy back to Molly's house instead of playing hide and go seek. As soon as they got to Molly's front door, Molly's neighbor saw them and screamed with joy.

The girls were very excited that they helped save the day!", "question": "The girls thought they saw a wolf, but what did they really see?", "answer": "A shadow of an old boot"}

Do you know the way back home?\" asked Jessie \"Don't worry Jessie, I know this area like the back of my wing I'll lead you home!\" Lucy said happily. \"Thank you so much!\" Jessie said happily.

It was not time to pick the red cherries, or the orange oranges or even the green lettuce, but their nice colors made Jill happy. She would eat some of the pies, and give the rest of them away to her friends and family. She went out to her back yard where the apple trees were, and started picking. A few hours later, she had enough to make dozens of pies. She walked into the kitchen with her apples, and was all ready to start baking when she saw she was all out of flour. She would have to go to the store to get some, since you can't make a pie without flour. While she was at the store, she would also buy some cheese, bread, and milk.

If students jumped over the holes, they might have sand thrown in their eyes.  If a student could pass the sandbox test, the next problem was the jungle gym. The fifth grade class came to recess before Mrs. Snooter's class and would hang out on top of the jungle gym. They thought they were cool because they were the oldest kids in the whole school, and would not let any other classes come near the jungle gym. It was difficult, but some students in Mrs. Snooter's class would make it past.  Finally, there was a long run to the seesaw. Only a few students would still be racing at this point, and they would run as fast as they could. Every day, there was one boy who would push himself a little harder than the other students. Most of the time, he was the winner of the race, and would play on the seesaw with his friends.", "question": "Which of the following things could happen to the students at recess", "answer": "have sand thrown in their eyes"}

I am not sure what they were but they were big and friendly.   I left his house and moved into different house. I had to leave my family. There were new humans now. They took me in this thing they called a car. It scared me! Everything was moving so fast. There was another one of those different animals. I think the humans called it a dog. His name was Rex. The humans were very nice to me but the dog was not. He would chase me around the house. I would have to hide under the couch or in some other small space. I heard the humans talk about taking me some place else to live.       Next thing I know I am in the car again. I am living in another house. Uh oh! This house has a dog and other humans. This dog, who they call Sophie, was very nice to me. She smelled me and licked me like my mother used to do! We became close friends. I liked this new house. The humans were nice to me too.

My mom took me to the store and I looked around for something Tom would like. We had to pass through the clothing, medicine, and jewelry sections before we got to the toy aisle. My mom told me to not let her forget that we need to go to the garden section to get a new sprinkler before we go, but I was too into the toys to understand her. Finally, I found a board game where you play as different cars to try and finish a race first and thought that was perfect even without the dinosaurs. From there, we checked out and I gave the present to Tom on his birthday. He loved it and we played with our other friends, Daryl, John, and Angie. Sadly our other friend, James couldn't make it as he was sick, but we still had so much fun together.", "question": "Which of Tim and Tom's friends didn't go to Tom's birthday party?", "answer": "James"}

{"context": "There once was a beautiful princess named Lizzie who lived in a castle in the woods.  One day she went for a walk to see if any of the spring flowers had started to bloom.  Her mother's birthday was the next day.  If there were flowers blooming she would pick some for her mother. Her mother's name was Queen Alice.  As she got deeper into the woods she came to a place that had a lot of flowers.  There were beautiful lilies growing around the edge of a pond.  There were some deer drinking water from the pond.  She picked some lilies for her mother, the queen.  The lilies were white and yellow and red.  She picked 12 lilies for her mother.  Lizzie also saw mushrooms growing in the woods.  There were birds building a nest in the bushes.  Under the bush she saw a paper cup that someone had left. There were beautiful butterflies on the bush, too. The sun was warm so she lay down to rest under the shade of a tree.  She fell asleep and as she was sleeping she had a bad dream.  She dreamed that as she was walking through the woods. In her dream she tripped over a log and hurt her ankle.  She started to cry because she was afraid that nobody would miss her and she would have to sleep in the woods.

{"context": "Max is a very happy cow. He's dark brown, with big blue eyes, and a soft pink nose.  He lives in a huge field during the summer, with beautiful, and tasty, buttercups and hay.  During the winter he lives in a nice, warm barn.   The hay isn't as tasty then, but it keeps him fed until summer comes back.  One winter day Max wanted to see what was happening outside when it turned cold and bright. He had never gone out during the winter because the Farmer always locked the barn door behind him. But today the door was wide open, and Max could see the sunshine reflecting off the bright ground. He had to know why! So Max pushed open the gate to his little house with his nose and walked over to the door. Max was surprised and confused by the ground outside, it was so white and sparkly. His breath started fogging in the air, and the ground was cold and crunchy. \"What is this?\" He asked the rooster sitting on the fence. The roosters name was Omaha, and he was all white except for a big red puff on his head.    \"It's snow, son! Did you grow up in a barn?!\" The rooster laughed and flew away towards his little rooster house.   \"It's so pretty!\" Max said. He pushed it with his nose. \"Oh! It's so chilly!\" He started to take a bite of the crunchy white bits. He wanted to see if they had a good taste, when he heard the farmer.   \"Max! What are you doing out here?\" The farmer, named Bob, asked. He was loud, but not mad. \"It's much too cold for a small cow like you, we better get you back inside!\" He pushed Max inside the barn, and this time locked the barn door tight.", "question": "What did Max think of the snow?", "answer": "That it was cold and pretty."}

He could not wait to get to the zoo and most of all could not wait to see his favorite animal, the lion. Aiming the football at the tire swing that hung in his back yard, he remembered the second thing his dad had taught him about throwing a football which was making sure his shoulder and the football were in a straight line before he threw it. He watched the football sail toward the tire, right as his mom called him in for dinner. His mom had made his favorite food, hotdogs. He sat in the kitchen and watched as ketchup fell on to his plate as he ate his hotdog. His mom told him that in order to get his after dinner treat he would have to eat his corn, carrots, and drink all of his milk too.   That night as his mom tucked him in to bed he starred out the window and wondered if the lions at the zoo were looking up at the moon too. Michael, wondered if his best friends Joe, Nick, and Ryan were as excited as he was about going to the zoo the next day. He closed his eyes and went to sleep.  The next day he hopped from one foot to the other as his class lined up to get on the bus that would take him to the zoo. On the bus he sat with Ryan. The bus driver started the engine and turned the big steering wheel leading them out on to the road.

He saw that he had three gifts from his parents waiting for him.  He had really hoped there was a basketball.  The first gift he opened was a new pair of pants his mom had bought for him.  The second gift he opened was a picture of his favorite basketball player to hang on his wall.  Jon was starting to feel nervous as there was only one gift left!  He wished and wished with all his might for a basketball.  The last box was a square shape.  If it was a basketball, surely it would have been round!

Twinkles loved to fly around the forest with her best friend Betsy the Bat. Betsy was a very forgetful bat. One day Twinkles and Betsy were playing next to the bushes by the river bank when Betsy shouted, \"Oh no, I've forgotten my lunch that my mom packed for me today! It is late in the afternoon and I am hungry.\"  \"Do not worry,\" said Twinkles. \"I am going to wait here for you until you get back.\"  With that, Betsy flew off toward her home in the wet cave near the other end of the river. An hour went by and Betsy still had not returned. \"Hmm,\" thought Twinkles, \"I wonder where Betsy went off to.\" Twinkles flew off to find her best friend.  Soon, she heard a voice calling from down below. \"Help me! I'm stuck!\" Twinkles looked down. Sure enough, it was Betsy! She had been caught in a pile of sticky mud near the mouth of the cave.   \"Don't worry, I am coming to save you!\" cried Twinkles. Twinkles swooped down to the ground. She found a strong stick nearby that she could use to help her pull Betsy out of the thick mud. Betsy grabbed the end of the stick that Twinkles held out to her. After some heavy tugging, Betsy was free.  \"Thank you so very much for pulling me out of the mud! I was looking for some berries to use for jam down by the river. They grow on the bushes there. I wanted some for a little dessert after my lunch. I accidentally walked into the pile of mud on the floor and got stuck.\"  \"No problem,\" said Twinkles. \"That's what friends are for.\"", "question": "How did Twinkles free Betsy from the mud?", "answer": "She held one end of the stick, Betsy held the other, and then she pulled very hard"}

All week my daddy and mommy helped me plan and now it is finally time for fun.  We got a clown and I got to invite all of my friends!  The clown's name was Bob and he was really funny.  Bob made us all laugh a lot.  After the clown left we all played fun games.  We played with a toy filled with candy and all got to eat it.  There were Twix Bars, Milky Ways, M&Ms and Tootsie Rolls.  My favorite candy is Twix so I was very happy to see them inside.  After that, my mom came out with my cake.  It was chocolate with chocolate icing!  Everyone loved it and we even got to eat ice cream too. We were going to eat hamburgers and hot dogs but my dog ate them all before we could.

But what can I do?\"  \"Can you roll?\"  \"Well, yes, yes I can.\"  \"Then roll over here!\"  And so Watermelon did.  They talked for a long time.  They sang songs.  They played games.  It was so much fun that Watermelon did not see the weather was changing.  Suddenly a strong wind blew, and it pushed Watermelon away.  \"Help!  Help!  I am rolling away, help!\"  \"Quick, Watermelon!  Get behind me!\"  Rock was afraid for his new friend.  Watermelon rolled behind Rock, and there it was protected by Rock from the dangerous wind.  \"You saved me!  Thank you\"  \"No problem!\"  \"You may be big and flat and heavy.  And maybe you can't roll around like me.  But I am very happy because of that!  I am safe because you are what you are!\"", "question": "What pushed Watermelon away?", "answer": "the wind"}

{"context": "I'd had the piggy bank for a long time. So long, in fact, that I don't really remember getting it. My aunt once told me a whole story about it, in which it was passed down through the family for many, many years, only to come to me.

And then, when I was fifteen, I broke it.  I didn't mean to. I was cleaning my room in a hurry, so I could finish quickly and go to a friend's house. I swung the vacuum hose around too quickly, knocking the pig's shelf, and down it went. About a thousand pieces, and way fewer coins than I would have believed, flew everywhere. I started to cry.   My mother came in at the sound of the crash.  \"I'm so, so sorry!\" I cried. \"I broke the bank!

Juno did not like baths very much and she ran away every time Billy got close to her.  Billy soon got tired of Juno's game, so he left her in the garden hoping she would keep running around and tire herself out.   Sasha the kitten followed Billy and Juno was surprised to find herself alone, she had hoped Billy would keep on playing this fun game.   To pass the time she watched some birds building a nest in a tree, Juno was so bored she even tried to play hide and seek with George, the parrot.

{"context": "Once upon a time, there was a little white mouse that lived on a farm. He liked to hide in the hay stacks where it was warm through the day and night. On cold winter days, he would wiggle out from the hay stack to get closer to the lamp in the barn, getting some extra warmth. One winter day, the mouse was very cold, but needed something to eat. He left the hay stack, and ran past the lamp. He ran across an old wood board that was laying on top of the snow - the mouse didn't have mittens and wanted to keep his feet warm. He ran and ran until he couldn't any longer. The cold weather was keeping every living thing inside, so the mouse was all alone. He walked towards the house and met a little bug named Fred. Fred told the mouse that he went inside and found lots of crumbs to eat on the kitchen floor. The mouse waited until the farmer's wife, Julie, came out the back door, and then the mouse ran into the kitchen. There were bread crumbs everywhere! The mouse ate as many as he could before anyone found him. He heard the back door open again, and hid under the oven. It was warm there - there must have been a pie baking. Farmer Bill liked pies more than bread, cake, or cookies. The mouse stayed there to warm up, then ran back to the barn to sleep for the night.", "question": "Who opened the back door?", "answer": "The farmer's wife"}

Last year I was a ghost, but this year I am a lion.  My little brother is dressed like a dinosaur and he keeps chewing on everything.  He is only 3 years old so I guess that is okay.  His name is Todd and his favorite holiday is his birthday but I don't think he knows much about any of them.  My dad loves Christmas and my Mom really likes Thanksgiving.  But I love Halloween.   We have to wait for my dad to come home from work so we can go out and trick-or-treat.  While we are waiting my mommy cooks us dinner.  She wants us to eat good food before we spoil our dinner with all the candy we are going to get.  I can't wait to go to my friend Kevin's house.  His parents give the best candy and give me extra since Kevin is my friend.  I think Kevin said he was going to dress up like a pirate but I don't remember.  I don't think pirates are very cool, but I didn't tell Kevin that.  I think I hear my dad coming up the stairs.  Tonight is going to be the best Halloween ever.", "question": "When can they go trick-or-treating?", "answer": "After dinner and their dad gets home"}

She warned them to stay as far away from the sock monster as they could.  Wanting to show how brave they were, Pizza, Dig, Mittens, and Bub went off to take a picture of the sock monster.  Before they left, they each packed one type of fruit.  Pizza packed an apple.  Dig packed a pear.  Mittens packed a banana.  Bub packed a grape.  It took a long time but they finally found the sock monster.  He lived in a cave.  The cave was under the school.  The sock monster was not looking in their direction when they found him.  As quiet as they could, they walked up to him.  Pizza got the camera ready.  Just as Pizza was about to take the picture, Bub tripped over a stick.  The noise caused the sock monster to look at the brave friends.  The sock monster was angry!    \"He looks mad!  What can we do?\" wondered Mittens?    \"Maybe he likes fruit.\" said Pizza, \"Let's throw him the fruit we packed.\"  Pizza gave the sock monster his apple.  The sock monster didn't eat it.  Bub gave the sock monster his grape.  The sock monster didn't eat it.  Mittens gave the sock monster her banana.  The sock monster didn't eat it.  Dig gave the sock monster her pear.  The sock monster ate it!    \"Thanks!\" said the sock monster.  \"I was really hungry.  Pears are my favorite.\"  No longer hungry, the sock monster let Pizza take a picture.  The brave friends returned to their teacher and showed her the picture.    \"You are all very brave,\" said the teacher.  \"But you didn't listen to me.  I am keeping the picture.  It is your punishment.\"  The brave friends were very sorry.", "question": "What is the name of the dog?", "answer": "Dig"}
{"context": "So, there was this kid named Jack that came up to my beanstalk one day. I couldn't believe my eyes, so I put down my ham sandwich I was eating and looked at him. I'm not sure what he thought he was doing there, but he sure did talk a lot. He kept asking me questions about this and then he asked me some questions about that and I was getting a little bit tired of all of the questions.  When I thought I wouldn't hear the end of everything, this Jack kid asked me about the one and only secret that I've always kept to myself. That no one even knew about! No, it wasn't about my golden guitar or even my goose that laid eggs filled with coins. No, he was asking me about my beans and their roots.   You see, I'm a giant and my job is to make sure the bean roots that we use to get down to earth are well protected and guarded. They're what helps us get down to the little person world when we need to. I became a little bit worried as the little kid asked more and more questions about my roots. I didn't want to tell him that my roots were hidden in the library!  I walked over to him to pick this little kid up to get him to quiet down about the bean roots, well, he got me with his little knife and I dropped him! Thankfully, he didn't get hurt or I would've been so sad!   He ran down the beanstalk when I chased after him. I guess he wanted to get back to his little people. I didn't follow him, but I sure hope he doesn't come back for my stuff.", "question": "What was the secret Jack knew about?", "answer": "Bean roots"}

We had to remember what to do when you come across a bear. The leader told us not to walk towards the bear. You also can not make any quick motions. The leader said we needed to start talking to make noise and to start to walk away from the bears. After a little bit of time we were away from the bears and we were safe.", "question": "What made these bears more dangerous?", "answer": "The bear was with the baby."}

{"context": "Many, many years back, in a place full of magic, there lived a man and a woman who were married. The man and woman did not love one another or anything else. The man was a wood man and often spent days alone in the wood. One day the man spent more time in the wood and he became lost. After days and days he grew hungry and weak. When he thought for sure he was going to die a tall wizard appeared before him. The man did not know the wizard had placed a spell on him, making him get lost, but he did.  The wizard smiled at the man in a friendly way and said to him, \"I can show you the way out of the woods, if you give me the one thing you love most in the world.\"  Since there was nothing that the man loved, he said yes at once. The Wizard showed the man the way home and then disappeared into the wood. The man and woman lived well for many years and the man never told his meeting to the wizard and after a time, he too forgot about his promise.   In time the woman gave birth and the man had a daughter who he loved. One day the wizard came to the door to take the girl, making the man remember his promise. The man was very sad to lose his daughter. But in the end he had to give her over to the wizard. The wizard was bad and locked the girl away in a cave. Every day the girl grew to be prettier and smarter. Every day the Wizard asked if the girl would marry him, but he was mean and she would not marry him. And every time the girl said no, the wizard would find a new way to make her sad. But the girl had found a secret flower that was very beautiful.  \"If you marry me I can let you out.\"  \"There is a lovely bit of sunlight that comes in through the rocks. I am very happy here in my cave.\" The girl said. The wizard became angry and steam poured from his eyes  He blocked out the sun so the girl lived only in darkness. Still the girl said no.

But the girl would still not marry him. The wizard became so angry he turned to flame and burned up. The girl was free and went down to her flower only to find it was gone. Instead she found a handsome prince.   \"I thank you my lady,\" he said, \"for saving me from the evil wizard. In return you may come live in my palace with me and be happy.\"  The girl said yes.

{"context": "One hot summer day in August my family and I wanted to go to the beach.  We had not gone to the beach in a very long time and felt that today was a great day to do it.   We piled everyone into the car-my mom, my dad, my sister, my dog, and me. I begged mom and dad to let me sit in the front seat, but they said no.  I had to sit next to the smelly dog instead for the whole trip.   When we got to the beach and opened the car door our dog raced down to the water to play. I grabbed the large umbrella we brought and walked down to the sand with mom and dad. After we had found a spot, they let me go play in the water.   It felt really good to cool off in the ocean water on such a hot day. As I swam around I saw many cool things, like fish, seaweed, and shells. I brought the interesting shells that I found to a bucket I had on the beach and threw them in. They would be great to add to my collection at home.  When I got tired of swimming, my sister and I wanted to make a sand castle. We built towers using buckets and dug a huge ditch with our shovels. When our castle was complete we were about to take a picture, but then the dog ran it over and smashed it. I was about to yell at the dog, but then mom said it was getting late and we had to go home.  When we got home I was wiped out from playing all day, so I went to sleep almost immediately. It was a very good day that I'll always remember.", "question": "Why did the dog almost get yelled at?", "answer": "The dog was about to get yelled at for smashing the sand castle."}

He knew that there was going to be a moon bounce, and that he was going to get a lot of presents from all of his dinosaur friends, but the thing that he was most excited about, was the cake! Larry's favorite food was cake, and he hoped that they got the right flavor. Larry's favorite flavor was banana. Larry went to school that day and everyone told him happy birthday! When he came home from school, all the lights were out. \"Hello?\" Larry said, as he came into the house. All of the sudden, the lights went on, and there was everyone! \"Happy birthday Larry!\" all of his friends shouted. Confetti went everywhere. \"Where is the cake?\" he asked. \"Here it is!\" said his mom, and brought out the cake. \"It's a chocolate cake, like you wanted!\" Larry froze. \"I said that I wanted a banana cake.\" said Larry. He was very sad. \"Now the party is going to be no fun.\" \"Oh Larry.\" said his mom. \"Your friends are here, and we worked very hard to set up this party for you! Please at least go spend some time with your friends.\" Larry was sad, but he tried to have fun. And the more he tried to have fun, the more he liked the party. The moon bounce was fun, and the gifts were very nice. He found out that you can still have fun even when things don't go as planned.", "question": "What is Larry's favorite food?", "answer": "Banana cake."}

He climbed under his bed and listened to the wind outside. He had his favorite toy gun to keep him safe, but he was still scared because his parents weren't back yet.

But pretty soon everyone was sick of peanut butter sandwiches and wanted to eat something else instead. Some boys went out into the forest and picked out berries and roots that were safe to eat. Some boys even took out the boat and went fishing. They came back with a big fish that they cleaned and cooked themselves.  At first, Frank's mom was very worried about letting Frank go to camp. She was worried that he could get lost in the woods and be eaten by a bear. She was worried that he might get into a fight with the other boys. She was even worried that he wouldn't shower or take a bath for the whole two weeks.
