{"context": "A: reading a newspaper B: looking for bugs C: swimming D: sleeping on his blanket. One sunny morning, Stewart chose to go to the beach. He knew that a rainstorm was going to arrive on Saturday and wanted to enjoy some sun before it arrived. \\newline\\newlineStewart laid on his belly and began reading his newspaper. As he was enjoying the sun and the newspaper, he saw a bug crawl across his blanket. At first Stewart thought it was an ant, but the bug was moving too slowly to be an ant. As Stewart leaned in for a closer look, the bug cried out, \"Excuse me, sir! Can you help me?\" Stewart was surprised and jumped to his feet. \"You can talk!\" he shouted. \"Yes,\" said the bug. \"Please help me! As you might know, there is a rainstorm coming into town. Unfortunately, I do not have a place to call home. I need to find somewhere to sleep before the rain washes me away!\" Stewart felt sad. \"Gee,\" he cried. \"That sounds terrible!\"\\newline\\newlineStewart thought about the problem. \"Perhaps you can stay at my house,\" he said. The bug jumped for joy and said, \"Oh, that would be wonderful!\" The two traveled back to Stewart's house and the bug found a soft spot to sleep.\\newline\\newlineThe next day, the sky had darkened and rain clouds appeared all over town. Just as the news had said, a rainstorm had arrived. When Stewart woke up, he looked for the bug but could not find him. Then, he saw something flying around his house. \"Thank you for letting me sleep here last night,\" said the butterfly. It was the bug! \"I knew I could not change into a butterfly if I was out in the rain. I won't forget your kindness.\" After speaking, the butterfly flew away. Stewart stood in his doorway and shouted, \"Goodbye!\"", "question": "one: What was Stewart doing at the beach?", "answer": "A"}

It came up to the squirrel, walked around the seesaw for a bit, then sat down on one end. As you know, an ox is a very big animal, so the seesaw threw the squirrel off and high into the air! The squirrel flew so high that it passed the buildings. It passed the birds, it passed the planes and stopped in the clouds. When it was there, it made friends with the clouds and asked one of the clouds a secret question. The cloud said okay, and sent the squirrel back to the ground. The squirrel fell and fell for a long time. Finally he landed on the seesaw, but the ox didn't move. \"Where were you?\" the ox asked, \"Just talking with a friend,\" answered the mouse.

Some people may like going to the movies, or the game room, or even to parks, but going to the candy store once a week and getting to see all the different colors and taste all the different treats is my favorite activity. As soon as we pull up, she tells me to not run around too much inside, but I'm so excited I barely hear her. She opens the door and we walk inside where the clerk first welcomes us. Since we do this each week, he calls me by my name of Trevor and says that he's come up with a few candies for me to try. \\newline\\newlineI walk over to the table and see three types of M&M's laid out. He knows I'm not a big fan of peanuts so he left out the peanut kind, instead giving me mint flavored, cookies 'n creme flavored, and white chocolate flavored. They all taste great and the clerk asks which I like the most. It takes me a bit to choose, but I finally choose the Mint as this week's choice.
