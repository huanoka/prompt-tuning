{"context": "One sunny morning, Stewart chose to go to the beach. He knew that a rainstorm was going to arrive on Saturday and wanted to enjoy some sun before it arrived.   Stewart laid on his belly and began reading his newspaper. As he was enjoying the sun and the newspaper, he saw a bug crawl across his blanket. At first Stewart thought it was an ant, but the bug was moving too slowly to be an ant. As Stewart leaned in for a closer look, the bug cried out, \"Excuse me, sir! Can you help me?\" Stewart was surprised and jumped to his feet. \"You can talk!\" he shouted. \"Yes,\" said the bug. \"Please help me! As you might know, there is a rainstorm coming into town. Unfortunately, I do not have a place to call home. I need to find somewhere to sleep before the rain washes me away!\" Stewart felt sad. \"Gee,\" he cried. \"That sounds terrible!\"  Stewart thought about the problem. \"Perhaps you can stay at my house,\" he said. The bug jumped for joy and said, \"Oh, that would be wonderful!\" The two traveled back to Stewart's house and the bug found a soft spot to sleep.  The next day, the sky had darkened and rain clouds appeared all over town. Just as the news had said, a rainstorm had arrived. When Stewart woke up, he looked for the bug but could not find him. Then, he saw something flying around his house. \"Thank you for letting me sleep here last night,\" said the butterfly. It was the bug! \"I knew I could not change into a butterfly if I was out in the rain. I won't forget your kindness.\" After speaking, the butterfly flew away. Stewart stood in his doorway and shouted, \"Goodbye!\"", "question": "one: What was Stewart doing at the beach?

Tim took an apple and walked to the bus. Since the race was after school today (school was letting out at 3:00 today, instead of 3:15), he knew he would be too nervous to think about anything else until it began. He didn't even bring his new book with him, an action book starring an orphan named Simon that Tim sometimes pretended to be.  3:30 arrived and the race was about to begin. All the other students had brought running shorts, but Tim was going to have to run in his school pants. Suddenly, he saw that his shoes were untied. As he bent down to tie them, one of the older boys kicked the back of his knee, making him fall down right as the race began. By the time he got up and tied his shoes, he saw he would finish in last place, as the other kids were much farther ahead of him.   It was almost 4:00 before Tim saw the end of the run. By the time Tim reached the finish line, the group of parents waiting on their kids was very small, as some kids had been finished for a long time. Tim's father asked, \"What took you so long?

The doctor told him Tim could be anything he wanted to be, and maybe he didn't like to run.

Even when the little monkey was very quiet, whenever he moved, the bell would jingle and his mother could find him.

{"context": "There once was a little monkey who lived in a zoo. He was a tiny brown monkey, smaller than all of the others. He was quieter than the others too. He was so quiet, in fact, that his mommy monkey made him wear a small blue bell around his neck so that she could find him. Even when the little monkey was very quiet, whenever he moved, the bell would jingle and his mother could find him.  One day, this little monkey had been running around under the yellow sun for a long time, with his bell going \"jingle jingle.\" He started to feel tired. But the other monkeys were still having fun and making a lot of noise. They were yelling and banging things together. The little monkey wanted to find somewhere quiet.  Finally, he knew what to do: he took off his blue bell. He hung it on a branch. Then he sneaked out of his cage in the zoo. He waited. He was very quiet and small. He waited until a young girl came walking through the zoo. She was with her mother and father. Then he jumped into her red backpack. He was so small that she didn't know he was there. The girl and her mother and father got in their car and went home.  When the girl got home, she set down her backpack. Her brother thought he saw her backpack moving.
