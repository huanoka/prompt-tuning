Puddles was lonely because he lived in an\\newlinearea where there were no other dogs, but only cats. Day after day, Puddles would have to\\newlineeat cat food and do cat things in order to fit in with the rest of his group. He found it\\newlinevery boring and Puddles was sad. Puddles didn't even look like a cat!\\newline\\newlineAll of the other cats teased Puddles. \"You're too big,\" they said. \"You've got too long of\\newlinea nose!\" \"Why are you panting like that?\" Puddles knew that he was different.\\newline\\newlineOne day, Puddles chose to run away from all of the cats. The cats laughed at him. What a\\newlinestupid dog! Didn't he know that there were monsters in the woods that could eat him?\\newlinePuddles didn't care, because Puddles was sad enough to try.\\newline\\newlineSo Puddles packed up his things - his squeaky ball, his water dish, and his bone - and\\newlineheaded off into the woods. He was finally happy! All of a sudden, Puddles turned. He\\newlinesmelled a funny smell. It smelled like something he had never smelled before. He turned\\newlinearound, and what did he see but another dog!\\newline\\newlinePuddles was so happy, he barked with joy. He went home with the other dog, who was named\\newlineMittens, and to his family. Puddles was never lonely again.", "question": "one: Where did Puddles live in the beginning?", "answer": "B"}
