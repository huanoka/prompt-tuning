A cat came also to see what Bentley was doing. \"Excuse me, but what are you looking for?\" asked the cat. \"Well, nothing important,\" Bentley told the cat. \"I wanted to see if there was anything cool in there.\" The cat told Bentley that his name was Felix and asked if he could dig through the trash too. \"Sure thing\" Bentley told the cat. The two of them started to dig through the trash again. After a little bit the pair got bored and started to walk down the street going away from Bentley's house.

Bentley's human's came home and were very upset that their house was now very wet.", "question": "Where did the two animals go after digging in the trash?", "answer": "River"}

They said they would not hurt me.  So I went in the room.  Guess what?  I was so scared when one landed on me that I went screaming for the door! The man watching the door to make sure butterflies did not escape or get hurt yelled at me to stop.  He was mad at me for running out and not caring about the butterflies.  I said I was sorry, but I was scared.  He checked me for butterflies and then let me get out of there!  I stayed outside and my mom and my brother enjoyed the butterflies.

The children loved the picnic foods they had. There were hot dogs, hamburgers, chicken and steak. They also had salads, coleslaw, fries and chips. The kids' favorite was hamburgers with fries.  On days when it rained the children and parents would stay inside and read or color pictures and drink hot chocolate and they loved to wear big warm sweaters.

When he was putting on his helmet, his friends told him, \"Helmets are for girls!  You're not cool if you wear a helmet!\"  Freddy thought about what his mom told him, but he wanted to be cool like his friends, and he took off his helmet.  Freddy and his friends went on a long adventure, and they rode all the way to the top of the largest hill in their neighborhood.  Looking down, Freddy was scared.  He had never ridden down this hill before.  His friends said, \"What are you, scared?\"  Freddy did not want to come off as scared.  He hopped on his bicycle, and down he went.  Freddy started speeding up, going very, very fast.  He pressed his brakes, but oh no, his brakes weren't working.  Freddy, speeding down the hill, did not know what to do.  He got to the end of the hill and slammed right into a tree.  He awoke the next day in the hospital.  At the hospital, his mother was there.  Freddy opened his eyes and told his mom the whole story.  He told her how we would never do that again, and how he would always wear his helmet.  His mom gave him a big kiss on the forehead, and Freddy knew his mother was right in the beginning.  She didn't have to say it.

One day as he was walking down the road a little brown and spotted puppy came up to him and wanted James to pet him. James reached down and petted the puppy and smiled. James hoped to see the puppy again. Many days later James went for a walk again. He thought to himself, \"I guess I won't ever see the brown puppy again. I hoped to see him again.\" A nice young lady said to James, \"Would you like a puppy?\" James said, \"I would like a puppy that was like the one I petted before.\" The lady smiled. She was holding the little brown and spotted puppy. She told James that she found the little puppy in the woods. She said that the little puppy did not have a family. James said happily, \"I would love to give the puppy a home!\" So James grabbed the little brown and spotted puppy and took him home. James and the little brown puppy became great friends. James named him Spotty.", "question": "Who gave James the puppy?", "answer": "a nice young lady"}
{"context": "The best afternoon I ever had with my grandfather was when we went down to the river and fished.  It was a hot July day, and I was bored. My grandfather was sitting in the backyard, reading. \"Hey, you look like you need some fun,\" he said.  \"Want to go fishing?\" I said sure, and he went to the garage.  He came out with two poles, some hooks, and some fishing line. Everything was in pieces, but he showed me how to put it all together.  I asked if we needed worms, and he said no. Then, we set off to the river.  It was only about ten blocks to the river, but walking along past the library and the store, he told me about how he used to go fishing with his friend Steve. They used to catch catfish, then take them home so that their mothers could cook them for dinner.  When we got to the park at the river, my grandfather went right to the bank, then turned and walked up along the side of the river until we were off in the shade under the trees right at the edge of the park. There, he taught me how to throw my line in the water. Then we sat down to wait. While we were fishing, my grandfather told me lots of stories about what he and Steve did as kids. We didn't have any worms, so we never caught any fish, but sitting there as he told me stories made it a great afternoon.", "question": "What did they walk past?", "answer": "Library and store"}

{"context": "Tim Goes To The Beach  Today was exciting. Tim's mom was taking him and his little sisters, Rebecca and Georgia, to the beach! They were going to go swimming.

It also felt great on Tim's toes, and his little sisters giggled when the waves hit them.  When they had had their fill of swimming, Tim's mom had them sit down to a nice dinner. They ate and ate.

Eliza had difficulties doing both her schoolwork and her dancing; she often fell behind in math. Her best friend Maddy was also a dancer; they often competed with each other to get the top parts in the dances. Their moms thought that because they competed with each other they might become mean towards one another but they did not let that get in the way of their friendship.  In their latest recital Eliza had got the top part in the dance called \"The Beauty and the Rain\". The hours were long and draining on their bodies.
